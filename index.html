                        Ursula K. Le Guin was an American Novelist known for her speculative fiction writing, whose body of work includes more than 50 pieces, spanning volumes of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction novels, essays, translations, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She won multiple awards for her work and, perhaps more importantly, has been cited as a major influence to current authors, such as Jo Walton and Ada Palmer, and creatives across mediums. Le Guin's <em>Earthsea</em> world was translated to animation in the Studio Ghibli film 'Tales From Earathsea (2006)'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of the reception of her work itself, Le Guin was considered an influential figure in wider social movements such as feminism, and explored themes of the effects of capitalism and potential utopian societies in her works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For more than 50 years, Le Guin continued to produce new works and inspire future generations of writers and in 2003 she was named one of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America's Grand Masters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
